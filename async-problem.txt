PROBLEM: 
* JavaScript by nature is asynchronous. 
* It executes independently of the main flow of the program

GOAL:
* Force functions to complete in the order that we need them to 

HOW: There are 3 ways to make JavaScript seem synchronous
1. Callbacks (not the best solution)
2. Promises 
3. Async/Await
